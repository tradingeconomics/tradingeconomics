Excel-DNA - WiXInstaller
------------------------

This is a user-contributed template (thank you very much to Lee Zeitz!) for making a WiX-based installer for an Excel-DNA add-in.

To use this, you will need Visual Studio, and to install the WiX toolset: https://wix.codeplex.com/

Some of the WiX project files also need unique Guids to be inserted for your project.

Version for making a Local Machine installer using Active Setup
---

Benoit Patra has created a version of the Excel-DNA WiX installer that uses the Active Setup feature in Windows to install for all users. The repository is here: https://github.com/bpatra/ExcelDNAWixInstallerLM and a very detailed write-up here: http://benoitpatra.com/2014/07/26/a-sample-wix-installer-using-the-activesetup-feature/

Any help to merge the installers, making the per-user or per-machine installations an installation option, would be greatly appreciated.
