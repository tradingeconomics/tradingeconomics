        #Load Data Directly Into Python
        
        If you don’t already have a copy of Python installed on your computer, you can get it from oficial website https://www.python.org/downloads/.  
        
        It's recomended to install pip, it is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. All information you can find on https://packaging.python.org/installing/. Then just type in Python (command line) 
        ```python
        pip install tradingeconomics
        ```
        
        There is a possibility to install package using easy_install 
        ```python
        easy_install https://pypi.python.org/packages/4c/b4/e2e2a9668be305a42c0644b3eb5d4d1034ae062653ef737d7e80c1423d28/tradingeconomics-0.2.x.tar.gz
        ```
        Where 'x' is last version number.
        
        As alternatyive you can download package from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tradingeconomics and then follow the install instructions for [Python 3.x](https://docs.python.org/3/install/) or [Python 2.x](https://docs.python.org/2/install/)  
        
        Another method is to download folder from GitHub https://github.com/ieconomics/open-api/tree/master/python and then place this folder in your Python library folder.
        
        ###Lets start
        In command window type
        
        ```python
        import tradingeconomics as te
        te.login('APIkey')
        ```
        If you don't have APIkey just left empty space in brackets.  
        
        **Note:** Without APIkey  datasets will default to returning sample data.
        
        ###How to Use
        
        Results are available in differente formats, such as : JSON, pandas.DataFrame or dictionary.
        
        To get calendar data for specific country, in data frame format, just type
        ```python
        te.getCalendarData(country = 'Italy', output_type = 'df')
        ```
        
        In some cases initial date and end date could be specified
        ```python
        te.getHistoricalData(country = 'United Kingdom', indicator = 'GDP', initDate= '1990-01-01', endDate= '2015-01-01')
        ```
        
        For several countries and indicators
        ```python
        te.getHistoricalData(country = ['United States', 'Germany'], indicator = ['Exports','Imports', 'GDP'], initDate= '1990-01-01', endDate= '2015-01-01')
        ```
        
        To get stock market index just type
        ```python
        te.getMarketsData(marketsField = 'index', output_type = 'df')
        ```
        
        Forecasted values for spcifique countrie, in this case Portugal. 
        ```python
        te.getForecastData(country = 'Portugal', output_type = 'df')
        ```
        
        Next code will give you Country/Indicator pair
        ```python
        te.getIndicatorData(country = 'United Kingdom', indicators = 'Imports')
        ```
        
        ###Bonus
        
        Easy graphical representation
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        mydata = te.getHistoricalData(country = 'United Kingdom', indicators = 'GDP')
        plt.plot(mydata)
        ```

        and some stratistics
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        
        np.average(mydata)
        # 1081.0103571428572
        np.median(mydata)
        # 827.63999999999999
        np.std(mydata)
        # 953.846661
        np.max(mydata)
        # 2990.2
        np.min(mydata)
        # 72.33
        ```
